# Welcome in Web Development

Hello everybody, welcome to my blog and to my self-taught project.
As mentioned in my home page, this my real project in order to become a frontend developer. I know that starting this carrer is tricky and require a lot of dedication. Along the way we will discuss about all the topics we're gonna find (languages, GitHub, IDE, tools, ressources...).

Let's talk about this project. First of all I wanted to create a blog starting by the simpliest way (with local data, and using React), but the purpose is to scale my blog using different framework, some backend, database ... So from this simple React I first add an Express server so I can fetch my data directly from my API. What I want to achieve is to get to a Next or Astro app with a database maybe PlanetScale or Supabase, and using markdown files.

This is the way for me to check my skills and my knowledge and get use to find the answers of my issues doing things and not following a tutorial.

In my next article (will try as best as I can to publish an article every week) I'll talk about where to start if you're new to this.

I really hope to grow with your support and your feedbacks so you can grow with me learning new things and creating more advanced sites or apps.
